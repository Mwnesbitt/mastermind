Coding plan:
A. User guesses the computer's code
    1. Get the computer to pick a code and print it.
    2. Find out how to do I/O from the command line-- press enter to make it pick a new code
    3. Have the program grade a guess given the code.
    4. Create the full game
B. Computer guesses the user's code (employs strategies)
    1. Find a way to structure so that you can employe sophisticated strategies and have organized helper methods (rather than rewriting code)  The strategies should be flexible where the caller method passes the ball back and forth, calling the strategy after each round with the updated info.  Some strategies, like randomguess, will ignore that info but that has to be how strategies work.
C. Computer plays itself and records output so that you can evaluate strategies



Have a few different files that govern it.  Like a MMstrategies.py file with the different methods that are strategies, like dontbedumb (check your previous guesses) and diversify(dont double up on colors when guessing)
need to figure out how to query the user for input on the command line
start the program by stating whether you're guessing or grading.  
After each guess the program needs to print the guess 4195 and the grade RRW in columns, so:
1234 RW
1456 RWW
2654 RRW
