# mastermind
mastermind is a project to implement the boardgame mastermind in python.  
The purpose is that this as an exercise to practice python and get familar 
how github works.

I enjoy playing mastermind and I think I can usually crack a code in the game (4 pegs, 6 available colors)
in about 6 guesses.  I wanted to test this by implementing the algorithm I use to 
play mastermind and run it thousands of times, checking to see if the average number of 
guesses required for this algorithm is around 6.  I also want to see if I can tweak this
algorithm or perhaps come up with a completely different algorithm that performs 
better.  

Additional analysis can evaluate how algorithms perform when the number of pegs
in a code and the number of colors is varied.  It might be fun to plot that 3
space equation in mathematica or write a program where I have to interface between
mathematica and my python program.
